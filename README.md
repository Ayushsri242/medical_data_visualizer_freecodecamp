### Repository Description:
The **Medical Data Visualizer** repository provides a Python project designed to analyze and visualize medical data as part of FreeCodeCampâ€™s **Data Analysis with Python** course. The project focuses on visualizing data from a dataset containing information such as BMI, cholesterol levels, and heart disease risk factors. The goal is to provide insights into the health conditions of individuals by using various data visualization techniques.

### Key Features:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleans and processes the raw medical data using the `pandas` library to handle missing or inconsistent values.
   - Filters data based on conditions such as BMI, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure to prepare it for visualization.

2. **Visualizations**:
   - **Heatmaps**: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between health indicators like cholesterol levels, heart disease, and BMI.
   - **Categorical Plots**: Uses `seaborn` to generate bar and box plots that group data by categories such as cholesterol level, overweight status, and smoking habits.
   
3. **Health Metrics Calculation**:
   - Computes additional health metrics, such as whether individuals are overweight, based on their BMI values.

4. **Statistical Insights**:
   - The project provides visual insights into how various factors like cholesterol, smoking, and activity levels relate to the presence of heart disease.
   
5. **Libraries Used**:
   - Utilizes `pandas` for data manipulation, `matplotlib` for plotting, and `seaborn` for more advanced visualizations.

6. **Testing**:
   - Includes unit tests to validate the correctness of the visualizations and ensure the data is processed accurately.
